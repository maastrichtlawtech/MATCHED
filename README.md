# MATCHED: Multimodal Authorship-Attribution To Combat Human Trafficking in Escort-Advertisement Data

**Abstract:** Human trafficking (HT) remains a critical issue, with traffickers exploiting digital platforms to advertise victims anonymously. Current detection methods, including Authorship Attribution (AA), focus on textual data but overlook the multimodal nature of online ads, which often pair text with images. This research introduces MATCHED, a multimodal dataset comprising 27,619 unique text descriptions and 55,115 unique images from seven U.S. cities across four geographical regions. Our study extensively benchmarks text-only, vision-only, and multimodal baselines for vendor identification and verification tasks, employing multitask training objectives that achieve superior performance on in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets. This dual-objective approach enables law enforcement agencies (LEAs) to identify known vendors while linking emerging ones. Integrating multimodal features further enhances performance, capturing complementary patterns across text and images. While text remains the dominant modality, visual data adds stylistic cues that enrich model performance. Moreover, text-image alignment strategies like CLIP and BLIP2 struggle due to low semantic overlap and ineffective use of stylistic cues, with end-to-end multimodal training proving more robust. Our findings emphasize the potential of multimodal AA to combat HT, providing LEAs with robust tools to link ads and dismantle trafficking networks.
